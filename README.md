# Responsive_Portfolio_1

## What, Why, and How
With this assignment, I was motivated to test my newfound skills by creating a portofolio with responsive design and formatting. To do this, I:
1. Created a functioning navbar that stays constant for each page and is responsive based on screen size
2. Created a container that was always contained to the viewport and never required horizontal scrolling
3. Made sure all the content stayed within the viewport and did not overlap with anything

The goal is that my portfolio should be aesthetically pleasing and easily viewable across devices and screen sizes. 

Through this process, I learned that positioning and layouts are SO much easier using bootstrap in comparison to other things like floats. I also learned how much easier it is to make content mobile responsive using bootstrap. I was able to load my portfolio on my phone, and the layout looked just as good as it did on my laptop. Finally, although this assignment didn't require an intensive use of the grid system, I was able to test my new knowledge by utilizing the grid system to create the format I wanted. 

The area where I think my assignment stands out most is in its mobile responsiveness. I was so proud when I loaded it on my iPhone and saw how smoothly the content transitioned from the the big screen of my monitor to the small screen of my phone. Even nowadays, it's so common to see professional websites struggle with being mobile responsive, so I definitely gained a sense of pride knowing that I'm on my way to understanding how to fix that problem.
