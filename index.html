                    <p>Hi, my name is Andrew Anthony and this is my first attempt at a portfolio! This is the About Me page, so why don't I tell you a little bit about myself. 
                        <br>
                        I graduated from the University of Washington in June of 2020 with a degree in Marketing. However, while my degree was in Marketing, my professional aspirations lay in screenwriting and acting. In fact, during the fall of 2019, I was a Script Intern for Conan O' Brien in Los Angeles. Upon completing the internship, I decided that after I graduated from college, I would move back down to LA to pursue acting and screenwriting. Then COVID hit, and as with so many other people, my plans went down the drain. 
                        I spent a lot of time reflecting, and realized that I had never seriously considered a career in programming. I had written it off years ago because I thought that it wasn't a creative path, but after doing some free coding tutorials, I found out I couldn't be further from the truth. I decided to go all in and signed up for this bootcamp, and I'm confident that 3 months from now I'll be Employer-Competitive and looking to find my first job in the industry.

                            <p>
                                I don't know where the future will take me exactly, but that's the fun of life. All I can do is make sure I've acquired the skills necessary to navigate life and rise to meet opportunities that cross my path. I'm confident that, when it comes to jobs, having my combination of storytelling, marketing, and programming skills will make me a strong employee candidate, and a valuable addition to any company that will hire me.
